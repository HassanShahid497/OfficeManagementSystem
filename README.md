# OfficeManagementSystem
This is a terminal based project of an office management system. 
The main idea is that of a corporate building that has an employee data base, a cafetaria for the employees, their parking arrangement, their bank accounts and status
and their gym membership status, as some corporate buildings have a gym.
There are 5 modules in this project  
1) Employee Management Module
2) Cafe Management Module
3) Bank Management Module
4) Parking Management Module
5) Gym Management Module
The modules, except the employee one, take date of an employee from the employee module (like their ID) and verify their status if they are an existing employee in the building and then provide them with deserved incentives, any one who's not an employee? they will be treated according to the nature of the module.
We have stored the date using JSON files.
